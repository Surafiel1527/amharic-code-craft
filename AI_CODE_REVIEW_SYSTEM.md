# 🤖 AI Code Review System

## Overview
The AI Code Review System is an intelligent, learning-based code analysis tool that automatically detects bugs, security issues, performance problems, and best practice violations **before runtime**. It learns from your preferences and improves suggestions over time.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Suggestions on Save**
- Triggered when you modify code files
- Analyzes code in real-time
- Provides immediate feedback

### 2. **Inline Fixes with Explanations**
- Each suggestion includes:
  - **Current problematic code**
  - **Suggested fix**
  - **Detailed explanation** of why the fix works
  - **Line number** for easy navigation

### 3. **Learns from Accepted Suggestions**
- Tracks which suggestions you accept
- Builds confidence scores for patterns
- Personalizes future suggestions based on your preferences
- Automatically prioritizes patterns you frequently accept

### 4. **Catches Bugs Before Runtime**
- **Runtime Errors**: Null/undefined access, type mismatches, logic errors
- **Security Issues**: XSS, SQL injection, exposed secrets
- **Performance Problems**: Unnecessary re-renders, missing memoization
- **Code Quality**: DRY violations, SOLID principles, naming conventions
- **Best Practices**: TypeScript strict mode, error handling, accessibility

```

### Database Schema

**code_review_sessions**
- Tracks each code review session
- Stores file path, code content, and language

**code_review_suggestions**
- Individual suggestions with:
  - Line number
  - Type (bug/security/performance/style/best-practice)
  - Severity (critical/warning/info)
  - Current code vs suggested fix
  - Explanation

**code_review_learnings**
- Learning patterns built from accepted suggestions
- Tracks acceptance rate and confidence score
- Used to personalize future reviews

## 🚀 Usage

### In Workspace (Multi-File Mode)

1. Navigate to **Workspace** → **Review** tab
2. Select a file from the file tree
3. Click **Review Code** button
4. Review suggestions by severity:
   - **Critical**: Must fix (bugs, security issues)
   - **Warning**: Should fix (performance, code quality)
   - **Info**: Nice to have (style, best practices)

### Accepting Suggestions

Click **Apply Fix** on any suggestion to:
- Apply the suggested code change
- Mark the suggestion as accepted
- Update learning patterns (increases confidence for similar patterns)

### Dismissing Suggestions

Click **Dismiss** to:
- Remove the suggestion from view
- Does not affect learning patterns

## 📊 Suggestion Categories

### 🐛 Bugs
- Null/undefined access
- Type mismatches
- Logic errors
- Infinite loops
- Memory leaks

### 🔒 Security
- XSS vulnerabilities
- SQL injection risks
- Exposed secrets/API keys
- Authentication issues
- CSRF vulnerabilities

### ⚡ Performance
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Missing memoization
- Inefficient algorithms
- Large bundle size
- N+1 query problems

### 📐 Code Quality
- DRY violations
- SOLID principle violations
- Poor naming conventions
- Dead code
- Excessive complexity

### ✨ Best Practices
- TypeScript strict mode
- Error handling patterns
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)
- SEO optimization
- Testing readiness

## 🧠 Learning System

### How Learning Works

1. **Pattern Detection**: When AI suggests a fix, it creates a pattern
2. **User Feedback**: When you accept/dismiss, the system learns
3. **Confidence Building**: Accepted patterns increase confidence (up to 100%)
4. **Prioritization**: Future reviews prioritize high-confidence patterns
5. **Personalization**: Suggestions adapt to your coding style

### Learning Metrics

- **Times Suggested**: How often pattern appears
- **Times Accepted**: How often you accept the pattern
- **Acceptance Rate**: Percentage of acceptances
- **Confidence Score**: AI's confidence in the pattern (0-100%)

### Example Learning Process

```
Day 1: AI suggests "Use const instead of let for immutable variables"
→ You accept → Confidence: 75%

Day 3: Same pattern appears → AI prioritizes this suggestion
→ You accept again → Confidence: 80%

Day 7: Pattern appears in 10 files
→ AI confidently suggests in all → Confidence: 95%
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Maximum Benefit

1. **Review regularly**: Check suggestions after each coding session
2. **Accept good suggestions**: Helps the AI learn your preferences
3. **Dismiss poor suggestions**: Teaches AI what you don't want
4. **Focus on critical issues first**: Address bugs and security before style
5. **Review explanations**: Learn why the AI suggests changes

### When to Use

- ✅ After writing new features
- ✅ Before committing code
- ✅ During code refactoring
- ✅ When debugging issues
- ✅ Before production deployment

### When NOT to Use

- ❌ Don't blindly accept all suggestions
- ❌ Don't ignore critical security issues
- ❌ Don't dismiss everything without reading

## 🔧 Technical Details
