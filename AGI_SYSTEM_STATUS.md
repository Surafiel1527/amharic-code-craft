## 🎨 User Transparency Features

### 1. AI Thinking Panel
**What Users See:**
- Current processing step with real backend message
- Confidence score with color-coded indicator (red/yellow/green)
- Classification result (type, intent, complexity)
- Detailed reasoning from AGI system
- Step-by-step progress with timestamps

**Example Display:**
```
🧠 AI Decision Making
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Current Step: "🔍 Validating my understanding through self-reflection..."

Confidence: 67% ━━━━━━━━━━━━░░░░░░ Medium

Reasoning:
"The request appears to be for a dashboard component, but I want to verify 
this classification before proceeding to ensure accurate generation."

Classification:
• Type: code_modification
• Intent: add_feature
• Complexity: moderate

Process Steps:
✅ Analyze user intent (67% confidence) - Just now
🔄 Execute generation (active) - In progress
```

### 2. Correction Indicator
**What Users See:**
- Detected issue with original classification
- Applied fix with corrected classification
- Confidence score of correction
- Reasoning for the auto-correction

**Example Display:**
```
✅ Auto-Correction Applied

Original Issue:
Classified as: meta_request

Applied Fix:
Corrected to: code_modification

Confidence: 85%

Reasoning:
"After self-reflection, the request contains specific implementation 
details suggesting a code modification rather than a general question."
```

### 3. Confidence Dialog
**What Users See:**
- Current confidence score with visual bar
- Original user request
- System concerns about classification
- Specific clarifying questions
- Input field for additional context

**Example Display:**
```
❓ Need Your Help

Confidence: 35% ━━━━━░░░░░░░░░░░░░ Too Low

Your Request:
"add a dashboard"

Our Concerns:
• Confidence is below threshold
• Need more information to proceed accurately

Clarifying Questions:
1. What data should the dashboard display?
2. Do you have any design preferences?
3. Should it include charts or graphs?

## 🔧 Backend Components

### Core AGI Functions

#### 1. Intelligence Engine (`_shared/intelligenceEngine.ts`)
```typescript
// Analyzes context before every generation
analyzeContext(conversationId, userId, request, projectId)
→ Returns: intent, complexity, confidenceScore, contextQuality

// Makes intelligent decisions about actions
makeIntelligentDecision(error, contextAnalysis, patterns)
→ Returns: action (auto_fix|suggest_fix|provide_options|clarify), confidence
```

#### 2. AGI Integration (`_shared/agiIntegration.ts`)
```typescript
// Logs decisions for learning
logDecision(analysis, context)
→ Stores in decision_logs table
→ Returns: decisionId

// Checks if correction is needed
checkForCorrection(userRequest, currentClassification)
→ Calls autonomous-corrector
→ Returns: needsCorrection, suggestedClassification, confidence, reasoning

// Performs self-reflection on decisions
reflectOnDecision(userRequest, analysis)
→ Uses AI to critique own classification
→ Returns: isConfident, concerns, recommendation

// Validates outcomes for learning
validateOutcome(decisionId, context)
→ Triggers learning if incorrect
→ Returns: wasCorrect, triggeredLearning
```

#### 3. Orchestrator Integration (`orchestrator.ts`)
**Confidence Gate System:**
```typescript
// Gate 1: Very Low Confidence (<40%)
if (finalConfidence < 0.4) {
  broadcast('confidence:low', { needsClarification: true, questions: [...] })
  → User sees ConfidenceDialog
}

// Gate 2: Low Confidence (40-60%)
if (finalConfidence < 0.6) {
  broadcast('confidence:reflecting', { status: 'reflecting' })
  → User sees AI Thinking Panel with "self-reflection" status
  
  reflection = await reflectOnDecision(request, analysis)
  
  if (!reflection.isConfident) {
    correction = await checkForCorrection(request, classification)
    
    if (correction.confidence > 0.7) {
      broadcast('confidence:corrected', { 
        originalClassification, 
        correctedClassification,
        reasoning 
      })
      → User sees Correction Indicator
    }
  }
}

// Gate 3: High Confidence (>60%)
broadcast('confidence:high', { status: 'confident' })
→ User sees AI Thinking Panel with "proceeding" status
```

## 🚀 Usage Example

### Developer View: What Happens Behind the Scenes

```typescript
// User types: "add a dashboard"

// 1. Context Analysis
const analysis = await analyzeContext(conversationId, userId, "add a dashboard")
// Result: { intent: "modify", complexity: "medium", confidenceScore: 0.45 }

// 2. Request Analysis
const requestAnalysis = await analyzeRequest("add a dashboard", context)
// Result: { outputType: "modification", confidence: 0.5 }

// 3. Calculate Final Confidence
const finalConfidence = 0.45 * 0.5 = 0.225 (22.5%)

// 4. Gate System Triggers
if (finalConfidence < 0.4) {
  // GATE 1: Too low - ask user
  await broadcast('confidence:low', {
    confidence: 0.225,
    questions: [
      "What data should the dashboard display?",
      "Do you have any design preferences?"
    ]
  })
  
  // Frontend shows ConfidenceDialog
  // User provides: "show user stats with charts"
  
  // 5. Re-analyze with clarification
  const newAnalysis = await analyzeRequest(
    "add a dashboard to show user stats with charts",
    enrichedContext
  )
  // Result: { outputType: "modification", confidence: 0.85 }
  
  // 6. High confidence - proceed
  await broadcast('confidence:high', { confidence: 0.85 })
  // Frontend shows AI Thinking Panel: "✅ High confidence - proceeding"
  
  // 7. Execute generation with monitoring
  const result = await generateCode(...)
  
  // 8. Log decision for learning
  await logDecision(newAnalysis, { 
    wasCorrect: true,
    userClarificationHelped: true 
  })
}
```

## 🔍 Testing the System

### How to See It in Action

1. **Test Low Confidence (Clarification Dialog)**
   - Enter vague request: "make it better"
   - AGI confidence will be <40%
   - You'll see ConfidenceDialog asking for clarification

2. **Test Self-Reflection (AI Thinking Panel)**
   - Enter ambiguous request: "add a form"
   - AGI confidence will be 40-60%
   - You'll see AI Thinking Panel showing "self-reflection"
   - May see Correction Indicator if classification changes

3. **Test High Confidence (Smooth Execution)**
   - Enter specific request: "create a UserCard component with avatar and name props"
   - AGI confidence will be >60%
   - You'll see AI Thinking Panel showing "high confidence - proceeding"
   - No interruptions or corrections needed

### Monitoring AGI Decisions

Visit `/agi-insights` page (if available) or check browser console for:
```
📡 Generation event received: {
  type: "decision",
  confidence: 0.67,
  reasoning: "Request analysis suggests code modification...",
  decision: { classification: "code_modification", intent: "add_feature" }
}
```

## 🎓 Learning & Evolution

### How the AGI Gets Smarter

#### 1. **Pattern Learning**
Every correction creates or updates a pattern:
```typescript
// After successful correction
await updatePattern({
  from: "meta_request",
  to: "code_modification",
  keywords: ["add", "create", "build"],
  successRate: (timesCorrect / timesSeen),
  confidence: bayesianUpdate(priorConfidence, wasSuccessful)
})
```

#### 2. **Bayesian Confidence Updates**
```typescript
// If correction was successful
newConfidence = oldConfidence + (1 - oldConfidence) * 0.1

// If correction was unsuccessful  
newConfidence = oldConfidence * 0.9
```

#### 3. **Outcome Validation**
```typescript
// After execution completes
await validateOutcome(decisionId, {
  executionSuccess: true,
  userFeedback: "positive",
  actualOutcome: generatedCode
})

// If outcome was incorrect → triggers learning
if (!wasCorrect) {
  // Store as misclassification
  // Update pattern confidence down
  // Potentially create new pattern
}
```
