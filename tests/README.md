# Automated Test Suite

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Run with Coverage
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### Run Specific Test Suite
```bash
npm test self-healing-system
```

### Watch Mode (for development)
```bash
npm test -- --watch
```

## Test Safety

All tests are **100% safe** and won't affect production:

âœ… Uses `AUTO_TEST_` prefix for all test data
âœ… Automatic cleanup after tests complete
âœ… Isolated test data - no production impact
âœ… Read-only checks on production tables

## Test Coverage

### 1. Admin Approval System
- Create/read/update approval items
- Approve/reject workflows
- Real-time queue updates

### 2. A/B Testing
- Experiment creation
- Variant routing
- Result recording
- Statistical significance

### 3. Rollback System
- Safety checks
- Rollback execution
- History tracking

### 4. Pattern Learning
- Pattern retrieval
- Confidence scoring
- Cross-project sharing

### 5. Auto-Generated Tests
- Test creation from failures
- Test execution
- Result tracking

### 6. System Health
- Success rate calculation
- Database function verification
- Performance metrics

## Test Results

After running tests, you'll see:
```
âœ… Admin Approval System: TESTED
âœ… A/B Testing Framework: TESTED
âœ… Rollback System: TESTED
âœ… Pattern Learning: TESTED
âœ… Auto-Generated Tests: TESTED
âœ… System Health: TESTED

ðŸš€ All systems operational!
```

## Continuous Integration

These tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
- name: Run Tests
  run: npm test
```
