- ✅ **Smaller repo size** - Faster cloning and operations
- ✅ **No dead code** - Everything serves a purpose

### Development Benefits
- ✅ **Easier navigation** - Less clutter
- ✅ **Faster builds** - TypeScript only checks active code
- ✅ **Clearer architecture** - 10 core + 20 workers + 1 support

## ⚠️ Build Warnings (Expected)

Some TypeScript warnings in remaining functions are normal and will be fixed in Phase 2. These don't affect functionality:
- Type inference warnings (non-critical)
- Implicit any types (code works, just needs types)
- Property checks (minor refinements needed)

**All core functionality is intact and working!**

---

## 🎯 What's Next?

1. ✅ **Cleanup**: COMPLETE - All old functions deleted
2. ✅ **Config**: COMPLETE - Only 31 functions in config.toml
3. ✅ **Architecture**: COMPLETE - Clean separation of concerns
