2. If it requires existing features (progressive enhancement)
3. Dependencies on previous work
4. Multi-step nature
5. Complexity level

1. Handles dependencies first (e.g., auth before protected features)
2. Sequences operations logically
3. Identifies what needs confirmation
4. Links to existing features when doing progressive enhancement
