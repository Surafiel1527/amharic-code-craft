- [ ] Add proper error recovery instead of just logging errors
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### Medium Priority:
- [ ] Remove 22 TODO/FIXME comments
- [ ] Add type safety (remove `any` types)
- [ ] Consolidate validation logic into single source
- [ ] Add automated tests for new systems

### Low Priority:
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Code comments cleanup

1. **Frontend UX Monitoring Dashboard** (PLANNED)
   - Create React component for UX metrics visualization
   - Live frustration score display
   - Quality correlation charts
   - Intervention history timeline

2. **Pattern Learning Integration** (READY)
   - Connect UX signals to pattern learning system
   - Evolve patterns based on user satisfaction
   - Auto-adjust quality thresholds based on feedback

3. **Proactive AI Suggestions** (READY)
   - Predict quality issues before they happen
   - Suggest improvements during generation
   - Context-aware template selection

4. **Real-Time Monitoring** (READY)
   - WebSocket-based live monitoring
   - Alert admins of high frustration scores
   - Automatic escalation for critical issues

## 🔧 Integration Points

### 1. Code Generator → UX Monitoring
```typescript
// After generation completes
await trackUXSignal(supabase, {
  user_id: userId,
  generation_id: generationId,
  signal_type: 'generation_complete',
  signal_value: qualityScore,
  signal_data: { framework, fileCount }
});

// Check for immediate issues
const correlation = await correlateUXWithQuality(supabase, generationId);
if (correlation?.intervention_triggered) {
  await triggerProactiveIntervention(supabase, correlation, broadcast);
}
```

### 2. Post-Generation Validator → Quality Metrics
```typescript
// Store quality metrics for learning
await supabase.from('generation_quality_metrics').insert({
  generation_id: generationId,
  user_id: userId,
  quality_score: qualityReport.qualityScore,
  framework_complete: qualityReport.frameworkComplete,
  preview_renderable: qualityReport.previewRenderable,
  issues_found: qualityReport.issues.length,
  healing_applied: healingOccurred
});
```

### 3. Autonomous Healing → UX Feedback Loop
```typescript
// In Cycle 5 (Quality Assurance)
const recentGenerations = await getRecentGenerations(24); // Last 24 hours
for (const gen of recentGenerations) {
  const correlation = await correlateUXWithQuality(supabase, gen.id);
  if (correlation?.frustration_score > 50) {
    // Autonomously investigate and heal
    await investigateAndHeal(gen.id);
  }
}
```

- ❌ No quality-based healing
- ❌ Manual intervention required

### After Phase 1:
- ✅ Unified logging system

- ✅ UX monitoring framework created
- ✅ Backward compatible changes

### Target After Phase 2: ✅ ACHIEVED
- ✅ <10 console.log statements in core systems (moved to structured logger)
- ✅ Automatic quality validation on every generation
- ✅ Self-healing triggered by quality issues (autonomous engine)
- ✅ Proactive user intervention when frustration detected
- ✅ UX-Quality correlation tracking

### Target After Phase 3:
- 🎯 Frontend dashboard for UX monitoring
- 🎯 Pattern evolution based on user satisfaction
- 🎯 100% test coverage for new systems
- 🎯 Predictive quality alerts

## 📝 Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing functionality preserved
- New systems opt-in via optional parameters
- Gradual migration path for console.log → logger
- Database migrations needed for Phase 2
