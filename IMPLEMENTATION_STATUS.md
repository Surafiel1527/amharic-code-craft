## 📊 Progress Metrics

- **Total Functions Target**: 30 (10 core + 20 workers)
- **Core Functions Protected**: 10/10 (100%) ✅
- **Worker Functions Created**: 5/20 (25%) 🚧
- **Overall Progress**: 50% (15/30)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Continue creating consolidated worker functions
2. Update client code to use new unified functions
3. Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
4. Test each consolidated function thoroughly
5. Deprecate old functions once verified
6. Update documentation

---

## 🚀 Benefits Achieved So Far

- ✅ Protected core intelligence (10 functions isolated)
- ✅ Started worker consolidation (2 unified workers)
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns (brain vs body)
- ✅ Reduced complexity in AI and code operations
- ✅ Better organization and maintainability

---

## 📝 Notes

- Each consolidated function uses operation routing
- All functions include comprehensive error handling
- CORS headers properly configured
- Logging added for debugging
- Supabase integration maintained
- Lovable AI models used for cost efficiency
