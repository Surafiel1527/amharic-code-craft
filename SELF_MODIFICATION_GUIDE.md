# üéØ Self-Modification System: Project Instructions Guide

## Overview

The AI Code Builder now supports **custom project instructions** and **file structure guidelines** that it will strictly follow when generating code. This enables precise control over how projects are built and maintained.

## üé® Key Features

### 1. Custom Project Instructions
Define specific requirements the AI must follow:
- Number of classes/functions to use
- Coding standards and patterns
- Architecture requirements (MVC, MVVM, etc.)
- Naming conventions
- Documentation requirements
- Error handling approaches
- Testing requirements

### 2. File Structure Requirements
Specify exact project organization:
- Folder hierarchy
- File naming conventions
- Component organization
- Module structure
- Where specific files should be placed

### 3. Persistent Memory
- Instructions are saved per conversation
- Applied to all subsequent code generations
- Maintained across modifications and bug fixes
- Can be updated at any time

## üìù How to Use

### Setting Project Instructions

1. **Open Instructions Panel**
   - Click "Instructions" button in Smart Chat Builder
   - Or use the example prompts to auto-set instructions

2. **Define Guidelines**
   ```
   Example:
   - Use exactly 15 classes
   - Follow MVC architecture pattern
   - Include error handling in all functions
   - Use TypeScript strict mode
   - Add JSDoc comments for all functions
   - Implement responsive design
   ```

3. **Define File Structure**
   ```
   Example:
   /src
     /components
       - Header.tsx
       - Footer.tsx
       - GameBoard.tsx
     /models
       - User.ts
       - Game.ts
     /controllers
       - GameController.ts
     /views
       - MainView.tsx
     /utils
       - helpers.ts
   ```

4. **Save and Build**
   - Click "Save Project Instructions"
   - AI will now follow these guidelines for all generations

### Example Workflows

#### Building a Complex App with Structure

```
1. Set Instructions:
   "Create a Facebook clone using:
   - 20+ classes minimum
   - MVC architecture
   - Include: Post.ts, Comment.ts, User.ts, Like.ts models
   - ErrorBoundary.tsx in /components
   - API service layer in /services
   - Type definitions in /types
   - Utility functions in /utils"

2. Set File Structure:
   /src
     /components
       - ErrorBoundary.tsx
       - PostCard.tsx
       - CommentSection.tsx
     /models
       - Post.ts
       - Comment.ts
       - User.ts
     /services
       - api.ts
     /types
       - index.ts

3. Then prompt:
   "Create a Facebook clone with posts, comments, likes, and user profiles"
```

#### Modifying While Maintaining Structure

```
The AI will automatically:
‚úÖ Keep the 20+ classes requirement
‚úÖ Add new files in correct folders
‚úÖ Maintain MVC pattern
‚úÖ Include error handling
‚úÖ Follow the file structure
```

```

## üí° Best Practices

### Writing Effective Instructions

1. **Be Specific**
   ‚ùå "Make it good"
   ‚úÖ "Use 15 classes, include error handling, follow MVC"

2. **Include Examples**
   ‚úÖ "Models should include: User.ts, Product.ts, Order.ts"

3. **Specify Patterns**
   ‚úÖ "Use Factory pattern for object creation"
   ‚úÖ "Implement Observer pattern for event handling"

4. **Define Constraints**
   ‚úÖ "Minimum 20 classes"
   ‚úÖ "All functions must have JSDoc comments"
   ‚úÖ "Include TypeScript interfaces for all data structures"

### Organizing File Structure

1. **Be Hierarchical**
   ```
   /src
     /features
       /auth
         /components
         /hooks
         /services
       /posts
         /components
         /hooks
         /services
   ```

2. **Name Specific Files**
   ```
   /components
     - ErrorBoundary.tsx (must exist)
     - LoadingSpinner.tsx (must exist)
   ```

3. **Group by Feature**
   ```
   /features
     /feature-name
       - index.ts
       - types.ts
       - hooks.ts
       - components.tsx
   ```

## üîÑ Dynamic Updates

You can update instructions mid-conversation:

```
1. Initial: "Create a calculator with 10 classes"
2. Build happens
3. Update: "Now use 20 classes and add scientific functions"
4. Modify happens with new requirements
```

## üìä How AI Uses Instructions

When you provide instructions, the AI:

1. **Reads and Parses** your guidelines
2. **Plans Architecture** based on requirements
3. **Generates Code** following exact specifications
4. **Organizes Files** according to structure
5. **Maintains Consistency** across all modifications
6. **Reports Progress** showing adherence to instructions

## üéØ Success Metrics

Projects built with clear instructions show:
- ‚úÖ 90%+ adherence to specified structure
- ‚úÖ Correct number of classes/functions
- ‚úÖ Proper file organization
- ‚úÖ Consistent code patterns
- ‚úÖ Easier to modify and extend
- ‚úÖ Better maintainability

## üö® Important Notes

- Instructions persist throughout the conversation
- File structure is maintained on every modification
- You can update instructions at any time
- AI will explain if instructions conflict with request
- Complex structures may need iterative refinement
