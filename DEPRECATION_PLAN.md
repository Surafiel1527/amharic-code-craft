## 📋 Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Client Library (✅ COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created `src/lib/unifiedFunctions.ts` - Client library for all 20 unified functions
- ✅ Created `src/hooks/useUnifiedFunctions.ts` - React hooks with React Query integration
- ✅ Added error tracking with Sentry integration
- ✅ Implemented retry logic and exponential backoff
- ✅ Added comprehensive TypeScript types

### Phase 2: Gradual Migration (NEXT)
**Strategy: Feature-by-Feature Migration**

Migrate components to use unified functions in this order:

#### High Priority (Week 1)
1. **AI Features**
   - ChatInterface → Use `unifiedFunctions.aiWorkers.chat`
   - Code generation components → Use `unifiedFunctions.aiWorkers.generateCode`
   - Debug assistants → Use `unifiedFunctions.aiWorkers.debugAssist`

2. **Code Operations**
   - CodeAnalysis → Use `unifiedFunctions.codeOps.analyze`
   - CodeOptimizer → Use `unifiedFunctions.codeOps.optimize`
   - Refactoring tools → Use `unifiedFunctions.codeOps.refactor`

3. **Deployment**
   - DeploymentDashboard → Use `unifiedFunctions.deployment.*`
   - BuildQualityGate → Use `unifiedFunctions.deployment.build`

#### Medium Priority (Week 2)
4. **Quality & Documentation**
   - Code review tools → Use `unifiedFunctions.quality.reviewCode`
   - Documentation generators → Use `unifiedFunctions.quality.generateDocs`
   - Accessibility checkers → Use `unifiedFunctions.quality.checkAccessibility`

5. **Infrastructure**
   - Package managers → Use `unifiedFunctions.infrastructure.packages.*`
   - Security scanners → Use `unifiedFunctions.infrastructure.security.*`
   - Snapshot tools → Use `unifiedFunctions.infrastructure.snapshots.*`

#### Low Priority (Week 3)
6. **Analytics & Monitoring**
   - Analytics dashboards → Use `unifiedFunctions.analytics.*`
   - Error tracking → Use `unifiedFunctions.monitoring.*`

7. **Supporting Systems**
   - Notifications → Use `unifiedFunctions` via unified-notifications
   - Caching → Use `unifiedFunctions` via unified-cache-manager
   - Automation → Use `unifiedFunctions` via unified-automation

### Phase 3: Old Function Deprecation (After Migration)
1. Mark old functions as deprecated in code comments
2. Add migration warnings in function responses
3. Monitor usage analytics
4. Remove old functions after 30 days of zero usage

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Final)
1. Remove deprecated function directories
2. Update documentation
3. Remove old function references from config
4. Update project templates

## 🔍 Old Functions Inventory

### To Be Deprecated (After Migration)
These functions will be replaced by unified functions:

**AI & Generation:**
- `ai-chat` → unified-ai-workers
- `generate-ai-image` → unified-ai-workers
- `code-generation` → unified-ai-workers
- `debug-assistant` → unified-ai-workers
- `generate-tests` → unified-test-manager

**Code Operations:**
- `analyze-code` → unified-code-operations
- `optimize-code` → unified-code-operations
- `intelligent-refactor` → unified-code-operations

**Deployment:**
- `deploy-project` → unified-deployment
- `build-project` → unified-deployment
- `deployment-monitor` → unified-deployment
- `auto-rollback` → unified-deployment

**Quality:**
- `code-review` → unified-quality
- `accessibility-check` → unified-quality
- `generate-docs` → unified-quality

**Infrastructure:**

### To Be Kept (Core System Functions)
These 10 core intelligence functions are protected and will NOT be deprecated:

1. `mega-mind-orchestrator` - High-level system coordination
2. `mega-mind-self-healer` - System-wide self-healing
3. `advanced-reasoning-engine` - Complex problem solving
4. `proactive-monitor` - System-wide monitoring
5. `proactive-intelligence` - Predictive insights
6. `self-learning-engine` - Pattern learning
7. `pattern-recognizer` - Pattern detection
8. `predictive-alert-engine` - Early warning system
9. `autonomous-healing-engine` - Automatic problem resolution
10. `meta-self-improvement` - System evolution

## 📝 Migration Guidelines

### For Developers

**Before:**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('old-function', {
  body: { param1, param2 }
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { unifiedFunctions } from "@/lib/unifiedFunctions";

const { data, error } = await unifiedFunctions.aiWorkers.chat({
  message: param1,
  context: param2
});

// Or use hooks:
import { useAIChat } from "@/hooks/useUnifiedFunctions";

const chatMutation = useAIChat();
await chatMutation.mutateAsync({ message, context });
```

### Benefits of Migration
- ✅ **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ **Error Tracking**: Integrated Sentry error reporting
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
- ✅ **React Query**: Built-in caching and state management
- ✅ **Consistent API**: Standardized request/response format
- ✅ **Better Performance**: Optimized function routing
- ✅ **Easier Maintenance**: Single source of truth
