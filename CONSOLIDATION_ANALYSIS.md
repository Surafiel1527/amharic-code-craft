### Group 10: Image Generation (2 → 1) - PROPOSED
**New Function:** `unified-image-generator`
**Consolidate:**
- generate-image
- generate-ai-image

**Keep Separate:**
- ✅ design-to-code (different purpose - converts designs to code)

**Reasoning:** Merge image generation, keep design-to-code for its unique functionality.

### Group 11: Documentation Functions (2 → 1) - PROPOSED
**New Function:** `unified-docs-manager`
**Consolidate:**
- generate-docs
- fetch-documentation

**Reasoning:** Both handle documentation operations.

### Group 12: Security Scanning (3 → 1) - PROPOSED
**New Function:** `unified-security-scanner`
**Consolidate:**
- security-scan
- security-vulnerability-scanner
- plugin-security-scanner

**Keep Separate:**
- ✅ ai-package-security-scanner (already part of unified-package-manager)

**Reasoning:** Merge security scanning layers.

### Group 13: Build Quality (2 → 1) - PROPOSED
**New Function:** `unified-build-system`
**Consolidate:**
- build-quality-gate
- physical-build-blocker
- smart-build-optimizer

**Reasoning:** All related to build process validation and optimization.

const Admin = lazy(() => import("./pages/Admin"));
const Settings = lazy(() => import("./pages/Settings"));
const Explore = lazy(() => import("./pages/Explore"));
const Deploy = lazy(() => import("./pages/Deploy"));
