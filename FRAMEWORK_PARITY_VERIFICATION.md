# ✅ Framework Parity Verification

## Test Checklist

Run these tests to verify HTML gets same features as React:

### ✅ Test 1: Small App (No Enterprise Features)

**Input:**
```
Framework: HTML
Prompt: "Create a simple todo list"
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ Single HTML file generated
- ✅ No progressive build triggered
- ✅ Standard generation path
- ✅ Works identically to React equivalent

---

### ✅ Test 2: Medium App (Feature Orchestration)

**Input:**
```
Framework: HTML
Prompt: "Build blog with authentication, posts, comments, categories"
```

**Expected:**
```
🎯 Feature Orchestrator: 4 features detected
├─ Authentication
├─ Posts system
├─ Comments
└─ Categories

Dependencies: auth → posts → comments/categories
✓ Build order optimized
```

---

### ✅ Test 3: Complex Database (Schema Architect)

**Input:**
```
Framework: HTML
Prompt: "Build e-commerce with users, products, orders, reviews, cart, wishlist"
```

**Expected:**
```
🗄️ Schema Architect: 6 tables detected
Generating complex schema...
✓ users → products → cart → orders
✓ RLS policies created
✓ Relationships mapped
✓ Indexes optimized
```

---

### ✅ Test 4: Large App (Progressive Build)

**Input:**
```
Framework: HTML  
Prompt: "Build social network with profiles, posts, comments, likes, 
        follows, messages, notifications, search, recommendations"
```

**Expected:**
```
🏗️ Progressive Build: 38 files estimated

Phase 1/4: Foundation
- 8 HTML/JS files
- Auth + Config
✓ Validated

Phase 2/4: Core Social
- 12 HTML/JS files
- Posts + Profiles
✓ Validated

Phase 3/4: Interactions
- 10 HTML/JS files
- Comments + Likes + Follow
✓ Validated

Phase 4/4: Advanced
- 8 HTML/JS files
- Search + Notifications + AI
✓ Validated

✅ Complete: 38 files generated successfully
```

---

### ✅ Test 5: API Integration

**Input:**
```
Framework: HTML
Prompt: "Add AI video recommendations"
```

**Expected:**
```
🔑 Checking APIs...
✓ Lovable AI available (no key needed)

Creating:
├── js/ai-recommendations.js
└── Edge function: generate-recommendations

✓ Integrated with HTML project
```

---

### ✅ Test 6: Conversation Continuation

**Initial:**
```
Framework: HTML
Prompt: "Build chat app"
```

**Follow-up in Workspace:**
```
User: "Add emoji support"
System: 
✓ Detected HTML project
✓ Updating js/chat.js
✓ Added emoji picker
```

**Follow-up:**
```
User: "Make it real-time"
System:
✓ Adding Supabase real-time
✓ Updating chat.html
✓ Real-time messaging working
```

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: HTML project gets React code

**Cause:** Framework not passed in context
**Fix:** Verify Index.tsx line 338 includes framework
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue: Enterprise features skip HTML

**Cause:** outputType not mapped from framework
**Fix:** analyzeRequest now maps framework → outputType
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue: Progressive build generates .tsx for HTML

**Cause:** Language hardcoded to 'typescript'
**Fix:** Language now derived from framework
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

## ✨ Enterprise Feature Walkthrough (HTML)

### Scenario: "Build Instagram Clone (HTML)"

**Step 1: Feature Detection**
```
🎯 Orchestrator analyzing...

Features: 8
├─ 1. Authentication (foundation)
├─ 2. User Profiles (requires: auth)
├─ 3. Photo Upload (requires: auth, storage)
├─ 4. Feed (requires: photos)
├─ 5. Comments (requires: feed, auth)
├─ 6. Likes (requires: feed, auth)
├─ 7. Follow (requires: profiles)
└─ 8. Stories (requires: photos, auth)

Dependency graph validated ✓
```

**Step 2: Schema Generation**
```
🗄️ Schema Architect: 7 tables
