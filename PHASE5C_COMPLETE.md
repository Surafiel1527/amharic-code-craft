- Tracks pass/fail rates, duration, and detailed test results
- Database persistence of all test runs
- Status tracking: running, passed, failed, error

### 2. **AI-Powered Test Generation**
- Automatically generates unit, integration, and E2E tests
- Uses Lovable AI (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash) for intelligent test creation
- Supports multiple test frameworks
- Generates comprehensive test coverage
- Stores generated tests with confidence scores

### 3. **Code Coverage Analysis**
- Tracks line, branch, function, and statement coverage
- Calculates coverage percentages automatically
- File-level coverage breakdown
- Historical coverage tracking
- Integration with test executions

### 4. **Performance Benchmarking**
- Multiple benchmark types: load_time, render_time, api_response, memory_usage, bundle_size
- Baseline comparison and regression detection
- Status tracking: improved, degraded, stable, baseline
- Percentage-based regression analysis
- Historical performance tracking

### 5. **Quality Statistics Dashboard**
- Real-time test execution metrics
- Pass rate calculations
- Average coverage tracking
- Recent failures monitoring
- Comprehensive statistics function

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Tables Created:

#### `test_executions`
- Stores all test run results
- Tracks framework, status, duration, and detailed results
- Links to projects and users
- Captures error details

#### `test_coverage`
- Stores code coverage metrics
- Auto-calculates coverage percentages
- Links to test executions
- File-level coverage data

#### `performance_benchmarks`
- Stores performance test results
- Tracks baseline and current values
- Calculates regression percentages
- Multiple benchmark types supported

#### `generated_tests`
- Stores AI-generated test code

- Links to target code

### Database Functions:

#### `get_test_stats(user_id)`
Returns comprehensive testing statistics:
- Total test executions
- Total tests run
- Pass rate percentage
- Average coverage
- Recent failures count

    type: string,
    filePath: string
  }
}
```

## 🎨 User Interface

### `/testing` - Testing Hub Page

**Features:**
- 4 main tabs: Execute, Generate, Coverage, Performance
- Real-time test execution with results
- AI test generation interface
- Framework selection
- Test type selection
- Results visualization
- Coverage metrics display

**Components:**
- Test execution panel with live results
- AI generation panel with code preview
- Coverage visualization (coming soon)
- Performance benchmarks (coming soon)

## 🔐 Security & RLS Policies

All tables have Row-Level Security enabled:

**test_executions:**
- Users can view/insert/update their own executions

**test_coverage:**
- Users can view their coverage
- System can insert coverage data

**performance_benchmarks:**
- Users can view/insert their benchmarks

**generated_tests:**
- Users can view/insert/update their generated tests

## 📊 Usage Example

```typescript
// Execute tests
const { data } = await supabase.functions.invoke('real-test-execution', {
  body: {
    code: testCode,
    framework: 'vitest',
    projectId: null
  }
});

// Generate tests with AI
const { data } = await supabase.functions.invoke('automated-test-generator', {
  body: {
    code: sourceCode,
    filePath: 'component.tsx',
    framework: 'vitest',
    testType: 'unit',
    projectId: null
  }
});

// Get test statistics
const { data: stats } = await supabase
  .rpc('get_test_stats');
```
