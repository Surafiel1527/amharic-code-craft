## 📊 How to Verify Your Privacy

You can check your privacy status anytime by calling this function in your code:

```typescript
const privacyStatus = await supabase.rpc('verify_user_privacy', {
  check_user_id: user.id
});

console.log(privacyStatus);
// Returns:
// {
//   total_projects: X,
//   private_projects: X,
//   public_projects: 0,
//   privacy_status: "FULLY_PRIVATE - All your ideas are protected"
// }
```

## 🔓 Making Projects Public (Optional)

If you WANT to share a specific project, you can:

1. Set `is_public = true` on that specific project
2. Generate a share token
3. Share the link with others

**By default, nothing is public** - you're in full control.

1. **Extension in Public Schema** - Cosmetic database configuration issue (does NOT affect your data privacy)
2. These warnings can be safely ignored as they don't expose your ideas or data
