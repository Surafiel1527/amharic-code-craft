- ✅ Comprehensive documentation with usage examples
- ✅ Type-safe exports

**Component Categories:**
- **Admin Components:** AdminSelfModifyChat, AdminSecurityDashboard
- **Code Components:** CodeEditor, CodeAnalysis, CodeReviewPanel
- **AI Components:** AIAnalytics, AIImageGenerator, AIAssistant
- **Deployment:** DeploymentDashboard, DeploymentManager
- **Testing:** TestGenerator, AutonomousTestingDashboard
- **Collaboration:** CollaborationHub, CollaborativeCodeEditor
- **Analytics:** UsageAnalyticsDashboard, QualityMetrics
- **Enterprise:** EnterpriseProjectDashboard, CICDPipelineBuilder
- **Intelligence:** MegaMindDashboard, SelfHealingMonitor

**Supporting Files:**
- ✅ `src/components/ui/component-skeleton.tsx` - Reusable skeleton loaders
- ✅ Multiple skeleton variants (Component, Dashboard, Editor, Chart, Table)

**Usage Pattern:**
```typescript
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import { ComponentSkeleton } from '@/components/ui/component-skeleton';
import { AdminSelfModifyChat } from '@/components/LazyComponents';

<Suspense fallback={<ComponentSkeleton />}>
  <AdminSelfModifyChat />
</Suspense>
```

## 5. Library Lazy Loading ✅

**File:** `src/utils/lazyLibraries.ts`

**Implemented:**
- ✅ html2canvas - Screenshot capture (load on-demand)
- ✅ prismjs - Code syntax highlighting (+ language modules)
- ✅ recharts - Data visualization charts
- ✅ jszip - Zip file creation
- ✅ browser-image-compression - Image optimization

**Benefits:**
- **Initial Bundle Reduction:** Large libraries not loaded upfront
- **On-Demand Loading:** Libraries loaded only when features are used
- **Error Handling:** Proper error logging for failed loads
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript support

**Usage Examples:**
```typescript
// Screenshots
const html2canvas = await loadHtml2Canvas();
const canvas = await html2canvas(element);

// Code Highlighting
const Prism = await loadPrism();
const html = Prism.highlight(code, Prism.languages.typescript, 'typescript');

// Charts
const { LineChart, Line } = await loadRecharts();

// Zip Files
const JSZip = await loadJSZip();
const zip = new JSZip();

// Image Compression
const imageCompression = await loadImageCompression();
const compressed = await imageCompression(file, options);
```

[functions.unified-deployment-manager]
verify_jwt = true

[functions.unified-code-quality]
verify_jwt = true
