## 📂 Files Modified

### Created:
1. `AGI_SYSTEM_STATUS.md` - Complete AGI documentation (new)
2. `DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_2025_01_11.md` - This summary (new)

### Updated:
1. `README.md` - Added AGI features and components
2. `PLATFORM_STATUS.md` - Added AGI capabilities and events

### Unchanged (Still Accurate):

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Users:
1. Try the system in the Workspace page
2. Make intentionally vague requests to see clarification dialogs
3. Watch the AI Thinking Panel during generation
4. See auto-corrections happen in real-time

### For Developers:
1. Review `AGI_SYSTEM_STATUS.md` for complete technical details
2. Check `supabase/functions/_shared/agiIntegration.ts` for integration patterns
3. Examine `src/hooks/useGenerationMonitor.ts` for event handling
4. Study `supabase/functions/mega-mind-orchestrator/orchestrator.ts` for confidence gates

### For Documentation Maintainers:
1. Keep AGI_SYSTEM_STATUS.md updated as features evolve
2. Update README.md if major AGI changes occur
3. Sync PLATFORM_STATUS.md with current capabilities
4. Add new testing scenarios as discovered
