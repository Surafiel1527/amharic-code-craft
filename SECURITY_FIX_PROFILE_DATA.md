# Security Fix: User Profile Data Protection

## Issue Identified
**Severity:** ERROR (Critical)  
**Description:** The profiles table was publicly readable and contained sensitive personal information including email addresses, full names, bios, and social media links. This exposed users to potential data harvesting, phishing attacks, and identity theft.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Database-Level Security (RLS Policies)

Applied comprehensive Row-Level Security policies to the `profiles` table:

- **Policy 1:** Users can view their own complete profile (including email)
- **Policy 2:** Authenticated users can view public profiles (excluding sensitive data based on visibility settings)
- **Policy 3:** Users can update only their own profile
- **Policy 4:** System can insert new profiles during user registration

### 2. Privacy Control System

Added `profile_visibility` column with three privacy levels:
- **Public:** Profile visible to all authenticated users (default for existing users)
- **Authenticated:** Profile visible only to logged-in users
- **Private:** Profile visible only to the owner

### 3. Application-Level Protection

Updated all components to never display email addresses to non-owners:

#### Files Modified:
1. **src/components/UserProfileCard.tsx**
   - Removed email fallback for display names
   - Changed to show "Anonymous User" instead of email
   - Updated getInitials() to never use email for non-owners

2. **src/components/FeaturedGallery.tsx**
   - Replaced email fallback with "Anonymous User"

3. **src/components/ProjectComments.tsx**
   - Removed email from display logic
   - Updated to show "Anonymous User" for users without names

4. **src/components/ProfilePrivacySettings.tsx** (NEW)
   - Created UI for users to control profile visibility
   - Three privacy levels with clear descriptions
   - Informational section explaining privacy implications

5. **src/pages/Settings.tsx**
   - Integrated ProfilePrivacySettings component
   - Added to user settings page for easy access

## Security Best Practices Applied

### âœ… Defense in Depth
- Database-level RLS policies
- Application-level data filtering
- User-controlled privacy settings

### âœ… Principle of Least Privilege
- Email addresses only visible to profile owners
- Profiles require authentication to view (by default)
- Users can further restrict visibility

### âœ… Privacy by Design
- Secure defaults (public with email protection)
- User control over data sharing
- Clear privacy information

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify RLS Policies:**
   - Test as unauthenticated user (should not see any profiles)
   - Test as authenticated user (should see public profiles without emails)
   - Test as profile owner (should see own email)

2. **Test Privacy Settings:**
   - Set profile to "Private" and verify it's not visible to others
   - Set profile to "Public" and verify visibility to authenticated users
   - Verify email is never visible to non-owners in any mode

3. **Test UI Components:**
   - Verify no email addresses appear in user lists
   - Verify profile cards show "Anonymous User" instead of emails
   - Verify comments don't expose email addresses

## Remaining Warnings (Non-Critical)

The following warnings exist but are not directly related to this security fix:

1. **Extension in Public Schema** - Pre-existing configuration
2. **Leaked Password Protection Disabled** - Auth configuration (recommended to enable)

## Migration Details

**Migration Applied:** 
- Date: 2025-10-02
- Type: Security Hardening
- Tables Modified: profiles
- Policies Added: 4
- Columns Added: profile_visibility

## Impact Assessment

### User Impact:
- âœ… Existing users maintain default "public" visibility
- âœ… Email addresses now protected from harvesting
- âœ… Users can adjust privacy settings at any time
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Security Improvement:
- ðŸ”’ Email addresses protected from data harvesting
- ðŸ”’ Profile information access controlled
- ðŸ”’ User consent required for data visibility
- ðŸ”’ Defense against phishing and identity theft

## Compliance

This fix helps ensure compliance with:
- GDPR (data minimization, user consent)
- CCPA (user privacy controls)
- General security best practices

## Next Steps

1. Consider enabling "Leaked Password Protection" in auth settings
2. Monitor for any unauthorized profile access attempts
3. Consider adding email verification for enhanced security
4. Review other tables for similar privacy concerns
