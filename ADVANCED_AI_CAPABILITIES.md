## üîß Technical Architecture

### **Tool Execution Flow**
1. User sends message
2. AI analyzes intent and context
3. AI decides if tools are needed (`tool_choice: "auto"`)
4. If yes:
   - Executes appropriate tool
   - Receives tool results
   - Generates contextual response incorporating results
5. Returns formatted response with embedded media/data

### **Model Configuration**
```javascript
{
  model: 'google/gemini-2.5-pro',
  tools: [generate_image, analyze_code, suggest_improvements],
  tool_choice: "auto",
  temperature: 0.8,  // Creative but focused
  max_tokens: 3000   // Detailed responses
}
```
