## 🔧 Required Enhancements to Mega Mind

### 1. Multi-Feature Orchestration Engine 🔴 CRITICAL

**Current Gap**: System handles single features. TikTok needs 9 coordinated features.

**Enhancement Needed**: Build feature orchestrator that coordinates multiple mega-mind calls.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Analyze feature dependencies (graph)
- Determine optimal build order
- Generate multi-phase implementation plans
- Track cross-feature integration
- Validate prerequisites before each feature

---

### 2. Feature Dependency Mapper 🔴 CRITICAL

**Current Gap**: No understanding of feature dependencies.

**Enhancement Needed**: Create dependency graph system.

**Example Dependencies**:
```
video-feed → [auth, database, video-storage]
comments → [auth, database, videos, real-time]
notifications → [auth, comments, likes, follows]
```

---

### 3. Complex Schema Generator 🔴 CRITICAL

**Current Gap**: Database migrations are manual. TikTok needs 15+ interconnected tables.

**Enhancement Needed**: AI-powered schema architect.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Generate complete database schemas
- Create relationships (1-to-many, many-to-many)
- Auto-generate RLS policies
- Add performance indexes
- Create triggers for real-time features

---

### 4. Progressive Implementation Engine 🔴 CRITICAL

**Current Gap**: Generates all code at once. Can't handle 50+ files.

**Enhancement Needed**: Phased implementation manager.

**Approach**:
```
Phase 1: Foundation (5-10 files)
Phase 2: Core Feature (10-15 files)
Phase 3: Social Features (15-20 files)
Phase 4: Advanced (10-15 files)
```

Each phase validates before proceeding.

---

### 5. External API Integration Planner 🟡 HIGH

**Current Gap**: No pattern for external API integration.

**Enhancement Needed**: API integration architect.

**Handles**:
- Video processing APIs (Cloudinary, Mux)
- Payment systems (Stripe)
- Analytics (PostHog, Mixpanel)
- Email services (SendGrid, Resend)

---
