- AI determines optimal rollback strategy (immediate/gradual/blue-green)
- Automatically rolls back failed deployments
- Learns from rollbacks for future improvements
- Tracks rollback success metrics

### 3. Features
- âœ… **Deployment Prediction**: Success probability before deploying
- âœ… **Intelligent Rollback**: AI chooses best rollback strategy
- âœ… **Health Monitoring**: Continuous post-deployment monitoring
- âœ… **Auto-Recovery**: Automatic rollback when health degrades

## âœ… PHASE 5C: UNIFIED MEGA MIND HUB

### 1. UI Components

**`EnterpriseProjectDashboard`** (new)
- Real-time system health overview
- Predictive alerts dashboard
- Smart build optimizations viewer
- Active deployment pipelines monitor
- Live metrics across all subsystems

**Route: `/enterprise-hub`**

### 2. Features
- âœ… **Unified Dashboard**: Single view of entire platform
- âœ… **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data
- âœ… **Alert Management**: Acknowledge and resolve predictions
- âœ… **One-Click Actions**: Run predictions, apply optimizations

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Run Predictive Analysis
```typescript
await supabase.functions.invoke('predictive-alert-engine');
```

### Optimize Build
```typescript
await supabase.functions.invoke('smart-build-optimizer', {
  body: {
    project_id: 'uuid',
    build_data: { /* build config */ },
    request_type: 'optimize'
  }
});
```

### Deploy with Prediction
```typescript
// 1. Predict success
const { data: prediction } = await supabase.functions.invoke('deployment-orchestrator', {
  body: { pipeline_id: 'uuid', action: 'predict' }
});

// 2. Deploy if confidence is high
if (prediction.prediction.success_probability > 70) {
  await supabase.functions.invoke('deployment-orchestrator', {
    body: { pipeline_id: 'uuid', action: 'deploy' }
  });
}
```

### Monitor Deployment
```typescript
await supabase.functions.invoke('deployment-orchestrator', {
  body: { pipeline_id: 'uuid', action: 'monitor' }
});
```
