# Awash Platform - Complete Integration Status

## ✅ What's Working Now

Your Awash platform has **full platform awareness** integrated! Here's what happens when a user prompts and clicks generate:

### 1. **User Prompts on Homepage** ✅
- User types: "Create a beautiful e-commerce website"
- Clicks "Generate"

### 2. **Awash Context Auto-Builds** 🚀
```typescript
// Automatically gathers:
- All existing files in workspace (file tree)
- Installed packages (React, Supabase, etc.)
- Project capabilities (backend, auth, database)
- Current route (/workspace)
- Recent errors
- Platform state
```

### 3. **AI Gets Complete Workspace Knowledge** 🧠
The AI now receives:
```

## 🔥 Advanced Capabilities

### The AI Now Understands:

**When user says:** "preview not working"
**AI knows:** Check routes in App.tsx, verify file imports, check component exports

**When user says:** "add authentication"
**AI knows:** Supabase is already installed, use @/integrations/supabase/client

**When user says:** "file X doesn't exist"
**AI knows:** Exact files that DO exist, suggests correct paths

**When user says:** "make it use our design system"
**AI knows:** Tailwind is configured, uses semantic tokens
