## 📊 Component Architecture

### Before (Duplicated):
```
AISystemDashboard
├─ Analytics Tab → AIAnalyticsDashboard
└─ Error Learning Tab → UniversalErrorLearningDashboard

Workspace
└─ AI Tab → PatternIntelligenceDashboard

(LiveMonitoringDashboard not used anywhere)
```

### After (Unified):
```
IntelligenceHub (New standalone page)
└─ IntelligenceDashboard
   ├─ AI Analytics
   ├─ System Monitoring
   ├─ Pattern Intelligence
   └─ Error Learning

AISystemDashboard
├─ Overview Tab
├─ Mega Mind Tab
├─ Analytics Tab → IntelligenceDashboard (Full access to all 4)
└─ Search Tab

Workspace
└─ AI Tab → PatternIntelligenceDashboard (Kept for context-specific use)
```
