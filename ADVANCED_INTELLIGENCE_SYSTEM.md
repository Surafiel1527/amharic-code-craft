    K -->|Pass| L[Mark Fixed + Learn]
    K -->|Fail| M[Rollback + Report]
```

### 2. **Proactive Monitoring** (NEW!)
The system doesn't wait for errors - it actively hunts for problems:

#### What It Monitors:
- **Error Trends**: Detects patterns before they become critical
- **Increasing Error Rates**: Alerts when errors spike
- **Unresolved Issues**: Tracks high-severity errors
- **Failed Auto-Fixes**: Identifies patterns that need better training
- **User Experience Metrics**: Monitors engagement and session health
- **System Health**: Checks database performance and API success rates

#### AI-Powered Root Cause Analysis:
When issues are detected, AI analyzes:
- Overall system health assessment
- Root cause hypotheses for each issue
- Priority ordering (which to fix first)
- Potential cascading effects
- Preventive measures

**Edge Function**: `proactive-monitor/index.ts`
**Frequency**: Can run on schedule (recommended: hourly)

### 3. **Code Quality Analysis** (NEW!)
Prevents errors before they happen by analyzing code quality:

#### Analysis Checklist:
✓ Common Mistakes (null checks, hook orders, cleanup)
✓ Security Vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, exposed secrets)
✓ Performance Issues (unnecessary renders, large bundles)
✓ Best Practices (TypeScript, error handling, accessibility)
✓ Potential Bugs (race conditions, memory leaks, infinite loops)

#### Quality Scoring:
- **90-100**: Excellent - Production ready
- **80-89**: Very Good - Minor improvements suggested
- **70-79**: Good - Some refactoring recommended
- **60-69**: Fair - Significant improvements needed
- **<60**: Poor - Major issues must be addressed

**Edge Function**: `code-quality-analyzer/index.ts`
**Trigger**: After code generation or on-demand

### 4. **Multi-Layer Verification**
Every fix goes through 5 comprehensive checks:

1. **Error Rate Check**: Ensures errors didn't increase
2. **Critical Error Detection**: Zero tolerance for new critical errors
3. **High-Severity Monitoring**: Allows up to 2 new high-severity errors
4. **Recurrence Check**: Verifies original error doesn't recur
5. **System Health**: Monitors overall success rate (≥70%)

Each check produces detailed logs for auditability.

### 5. **Comprehensive Logging System**
Structured, emoji-based logging throughout the entire application:

#### Log Levels:
- 🚨 **Critical**: System-breaking errors
- 🔴 **High**: Major functionality errors
- 🔶 **Medium**: Moderate issues
- ⚠️ **Low**: Minor warnings
- ✅ **Success**: Successful operations
- ℹ️ **Info**: General information
- 🔍 **Debug**: Detailed debugging info

#### Enhanced Components:
- `useAuth.tsx` - Authentication flow logging
- `ChatInterface.tsx` - Conversation operations
- `useErrorMonitor.ts` - Global error capture
- `errorLogger.ts` - Centralized logging utility

### 6. **Advanced AI Prompts**
The AI receives comprehensive context for every analysis:

#### Included Context:
- **Full Tech Stack**: React 18.3.1, TypeScript 5.x, Vite 5.x, Supabase, etc.
- **Architectural Patterns**: Component structure, state management, data fetching
- **Security Patterns**: RLS policies, auth checks, API key handling
- **Database Patterns**: Primary keys, timestamps, foreign keys, realtime
- **UI/UX Patterns**: Design tokens, accessibility, responsive design
- **Performance Patterns**: Code splitting, memoization, lazy loading
- **React Patterns**: Hooks order, effect cleanup, error boundaries
- **API Patterns**: Edge functions, CORS, retry logic
- **Common Pitfalls**: 10+ specific anti-patterns to avoid
- **Project-Specific**: Self-healing, AI integration, conversations

## 🔥 Advanced Features

### Pattern Learning Engine
Every successful fix automatically adds to the knowledge base:

```typescript
// After fix verification passes
await supabaseClient
  .from('error_patterns')
  .upsert({
    error_type: fix.detected_errors.error_type,
    error_pattern: fix.detected_errors.error_message,
    solution: fix.explanation,
    resolution_status: 'solved',
    auto_fix_success_rate: 1.0,
    frequency: 1
  });
```

### Confidence Reasoning
AI provides detailed reasoning for every confidence score:

```json
{
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "reasoning": "High confidence based on:
    - Exact pattern match found in knowledge base (91% success rate)
    - Complete error information with full stack trace
    - Simple fix with proven solution
    - 45 similar successful resolutions in past"
}
```

### Admin Notifications
Critical events trigger immediate admin notifications:
- 🚨 New critical errors
- ⚠️ Proactive monitor detects issues
- 🔧 Low-confidence fixes need review
- ✅ Successful auto-fixes applied
- ⚠️ Auto-fixes rolled back

## 🛠️ How to Use

### For Developers

#### 1. Use the Error Logger
```typescript
import { logError, withErrorLogging } from '@/utils/errorLogger';

// Manual error logging
try {
  await riskyOperation();
} catch (error) {
  await logError({
    errorType: 'OperationFailed',
    errorMessage: error.message,
    source: 'frontend',
    severity: 'high',
    filePath: 'components/MyComponent.tsx',
    functionName: 'riskyOperation',
    context: { userId: user.id, operation: 'update' }
  });
  throw error;
}

// Automatic error logging with wrapper
const safeFunction = withErrorLogging(
  async (data: any) => {
    // Your code here
  },
  {
    filePath: 'utils/api.ts',
    functionName: 'apiCall',
    source: 'api',
    severity: 'high'
  }
);
```

#### 2. Trigger Proactive Monitoring
```typescript
// Manually trigger system health check
const { data } = await supabase.functions.invoke('proactive-monitor');
console.log('Health:', data.overall_health);
console.log('Issues:', data.issues);
console.log('Recommendations:', data.recommendations);
```

#### 3. Analyze Code Quality
```typescript
// Before deploying new code
const { data } = await supabase.functions.invoke('code-quality-analyzer', {
  body: {
    code: generatedCode,
    context: { projectId: 'abc-123' }
  }
});

if (data.qualityScore < 70) {
  console.warn('Code quality issues:', data.issues);
}
```

### For Administrators

#### 1. Monitor Self-Healing Dashboard
Navigate to `/admin` → "Self-Healing" tab to view:
- Real-time error detection
- Applied fixes and their status
- System health metrics
- Error patterns learned

#### 2. Review Low-Confidence Fixes
Check notifications for fixes that need manual review:
- Review AI's analysis and proposed fix
- Test fix in staging if needed
- Approve or reject with feedback
- Approved fixes add to knowledge base

#### 3. Run Manual Diagnostics
```typescript
// Get system health report
const { data: health } = await supabase
  .from('system_health')
  .select('*')
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(10);

// Get recent auto-fixes
const { data: fixes } = await supabase
  .from('auto_fixes')
  .select('*, detected_errors(*)')
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(20);

// Analyze patterns
const { data: patterns } = await supabase
  .from('error_patterns')
  .select('*')
  .eq('resolution_status', 'solved')
  .order('frequency', { ascending: false });
```
